	// Alloc is bytes of allocated heap objects.
	Alloc        uint64

	// TotalAlloc is cumulative bytes allocated for heap objects.
	//
	// TotalAlloc increases as heap objects are allocated, but
	// unlike Alloc and HeapAlloc, it does not decrease when
	// objects are freed.
	TotalAlloc   uint64

	// Sys is the total bytes of memory obtained from the OS.
	//
	// Sys is the sum of the XSys fields below. Sys measures the
	// virtual address space reserved by the Go runtime for the
	// heap, stacks, and other internal data structures. It's
	// likely that not all of the virtual address space is backed
	// by physical memory at any given moment, though in general
	// it all was at some point.
	Sys          uint64

	// Lookups is the number of pointer lookups performed by the
	// runtime.
	//
	// This is primarily useful for debugging runtime internals.
	Lookups      uint64

	// Mallocs is the cumulative count of heap objects allocated.
	Mallocs      uint64

	// Frees is the cumulative count of heap objects freed.
	Frees        uint64

	// The number of live objects is Mallocs - Frees.
	LiveObjects  uint64

	// HeapAlloc is bytes of allocated heap objects.
	//
	// "Allocated" heap objects include all reachable objects, as
	// well as unreachable objects that the garbage collector has
	// not yet freed. Specifically, HeapAlloc increases as heap
	// objects are allocated and decreases as the heap is swept
	// and unreachable objects are freed. Sweeping occurs
	// incrementally between GC cycles, so these two processes
	// occur simultaneously, and as a result HeapAlloc tends to
	// change smoothly (in contrast with the sawtooth that is
	// typical of stop-the-world garbage collectors).
	HeapAlloc    uint64

	// HeapSys is bytes of heap memory obtained from the OS.
	//
	// HeapSys measures the amount of virtual address space
	// reserved for the heap. This includes virtual address space
	// that has been reserved but not yet used, which consumes no
	// physical memory, but tends to be small, as well as virtual
	// address space for which the physical memory has been
	// returned to the OS after it became unused (see HeapReleased
	// for a measure of the latter).
	//
	// HeapSys estimates the largest size the heap has had.
	HeapSys      uint64

	// HeapIdle is bytes in idle (unused) spans.
	//
	// Idle spans have no objects in them. These spans could be
	// (and may already have been) returned to the OS, or they can
	// be reused for heap allocations, or they can be reused as
	// stack memory.
	//
	// HeapIdle minus HeapReleased estimates the amount of memory
	// that could be returned to the OS, but is being retained by
	// the runtime so it can grow the heap without requesting more
	// memory from the OS. If this difference is significantly
	// larger than the heap size, it indicates there was a recent
	// transient spike in live heap size.
	HeapIdle     uint64

	// HeapInuse is bytes in in-use spans.
	//
	// In-use spans have at least one object in them. These spans
	// can only be used for other objects of roughly the same
	// size.
	//
	// HeapInuse minus HeapAlloc estimates the amount of memory
	// that has been dedicated to particular size classes, but is
	// not currently being used. This is an upper bound on
	// fragmentation, but in general this memory can be reused
	// efficiently.
	HeapInuse    uint64

	// HeapReleased is bytes of physical memory returned to the OS.
	//
	// This counts heap memory from idle spans that was returned
	// to the OS and has not yet been reacquired for the heap.
	HeapReleased uint64

	// StackInuse is bytes in stack spans.
	//
	// In-use stack spans have at least one stack in them. These
	// spans can only be used for other stacks of the same size.
	//
	// There is no StackIdle because unused stack spans are
	// returned to the heap (and hence counted toward HeapIdle).
	StackInuse   uint64

	// StackSys is bytes of stack memory obtained from the OS.
	//
	// StackSys is StackInuse, plus any memory obtained directly
	// from the OS for OS thread stacks (which should be minimal).
	StackSys     uint64

	// GCSys is bytes of memory in garbage collection metadata.
	GCSys        uint64

	// NextGC is the target heap size of the next GC cycle.
	//
	// The garbage collector's goal is to keep HeapAlloc â‰¤ NextGC.
	// At the end of each GC cycle, the target for the next cycle
	// is computed based on the amount of reachable data and the
	// value of GOGC.
	NextGC       uint64

	// LastGC is the time the last garbage collection finished, as
	// nanoseconds since 1970 (the UNIX epoch).
	LastGC       uint64

	// PauseTotalNs is the cumulative nanoseconds in GC
	// stop-the-world pauses since the program started.
	//
	// During a stop-the-world pause, all goroutines are paused
	// and only the garbage collector can run.
	PauseTotalNs uint64

	// NumGC is the number of completed GC cycles.
	NumGC        uint32

	// NumGoroutine returns the number of goroutines that currently exist.
	NumGoroutine int
